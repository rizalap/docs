       Second Task Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are now in the fourth round of The Second Task, you are still paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.

    <p>
    In this round, both the sender and the receiver will share {{ Constants.endowment }} lab token. <strong> The Sender </strong> will decide how much <strong> the sender </strong>
       will retain. Then the rest will go to <strong>the receiver</strong>. The receiver, however, will receive additional 10 points of token irrespective the amount of endowment you share with them.
       Prior to making a decision, our algorithm will generate a number that determines the proportion of your endowment share. This information is only observed by <strong>the sender</strong>.
